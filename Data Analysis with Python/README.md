# Data Analysis with Python

## <u>1)Python Packages for Data Science</u>

A Python library is a collection of functions and methods that allow you to perform lots of actions without writing any code. 
The libraries usually contain built in modules providing different functionalities which you can use directly and there are extensive libraries offering a broad range of facilities. 
We have divided the Python data analysis libraries into three groups. 


#### Scientific Computing Libraries
  
  1) <b>Pandas</b> = Pandas offers data structure and tools for effective data manipulation and analysis. It provides facts, access to structured data. The primary instrument of Pandas is the two dimensional table consisting of column and row labels, which are called a data frame. It is designed to provid easy indexing functionality. 
  2) <b>Numpy</b> = The NumPy library uses arrays for its inputs and outputs. It can be extended to objects for matrices and with minor coding changes, developers can perform fast array processing.
  3) <b>SciPy</b>= This Library includes functions for some advanced math problems as listed on this slide, as well as data visualization.
 
#### Visualization Libraries (These libraries enable you to create graphs, charts and maps.)
  
  1) <b>Matplot</b> = Matplotlib package is the most well known library for data visualization. It is great for making graphs and plots. The graphs are also highly customizable.
  2) <b>Seaborn</b> = It is based on Matplotlib. It's very easy to generate various plots such as heat maps, time series and violin plots.

#### Algorithmic Libraries
  
  1) <b>Scikit-Learn</b> = the Scikit-learn library contains tools statistical modeling, including regression, classification, clustering, and so on. This library is built on NumPy, SciPy and Matplotib. 
  2) <b>Statsmodel</b> = Statsmodels is also a Python module that allows users to explore data, estimate statistical models and perform statistical tests. 

## <u>2)Understanding the Problem & Data</u>

## <u>3)Importing & Exporting Data in Python</u>
Once we have our data in Python, then we can perform all the subsequent data analysis procedures we need.
To read any data using Python's pandas package, there are two important factors to consider,
* Format = Format is the way data is encoded. We can usually tell different encoding schemes by looking at the ending of the file name.
  * Some common encodings are: CSV, JSON, XLSX, HDF and so forth. 
* File Path = The path tells us where the data is stored. Usually, it is stored either on the, 
  * Computer = "C:/ThisPC/Users/Desktop/data.csv"
  * Internet = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/autps/imports-85.data"
